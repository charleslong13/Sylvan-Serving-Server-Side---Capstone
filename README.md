# Sylvan-Serving-Server-Side---Capstone

Created with Django

Server-side Capstone Project "Sylvan Serving": The purpose of this application is a Magic the Gathering companion application that can be used to connect with other players, improve your deck building skills, keep track of your deck collections, and create game night events so people can get together to play! Utilizing React, Django, JSX, CSS.

Currently in progress for my final Capstone Project (Due March 25th)

Users will be able to register an account (where they will have the option of choosing to become an event administrator) and log in where they will have access to general rules and information about the game, a feed of decks being created by all users, the ability to create/read/update/destroy their own deck lists, view posted game night events, and  create/read/update/destroy game night events that they created. Users will also be able to click on a user’s name and be taken to a user’s detail page where they can find out information about the user and see the decks that user has created. Users will also be able to click on the title of a deck list and see a deck list detail page with all of the information about that deck list. In the deck list form users will also have the option to input a url to a picture of their Commander card.

This application for anyone who enjoys the game of Magic and for Local Game Stores and tabletop players alike to schedule IRL events and keep track of RSVP's.
